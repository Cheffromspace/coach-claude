# Server Management and Windows Networking

## Overview
The server management system provides robust handling of MCP server processes with specialized Windows networking optimizations and comprehensive health monitoring.

## Process Management

### Initialization
- Process creation with minimal required access rights
- Priority class setting for optimal performance
- Automatic network stack initialization
- DNS cache pre-warming

### Health Monitoring
- Periodic health checks (5-minute intervals)
- Tool availability verification
- Process state monitoring
- Connection status tracking

### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry logic (max 3 attempts)
- Exponential backoff (1-10 seconds)
- Graceful cleanup on failures
- Session state preservation

## Windows Networking Optimizations

### Network Stack Configuration
- Winsock initialization and cleanup
- DNS resolution optimization
  * IPv4 prioritization
  * Cache initialization
  * Resolution order control
- Network priority management

### Process Network Setup
- Thread pool size configuration (4 threads)
- Debug logging configuration
  * HTTP debugging enabled
  * DNS debugging enabled
  * Network traffic logging disabled
- Node.js specific optimizations
  * Trace warnings enabled
  * DNS result order control
  * UV thread pool configuration

## Resource Management

### Process Cleanup
1. Graceful Termination
   - Initial terminate signal
   - 100ms grace period
   - Process state verification

2. Force Cleanup
   - Kill signal if graceful termination fails
   - Resource handle cleanup
   - Network socket cleanup

### Connection Management
- Stdio-based communication
- Output capture and logging
- Error handling and recovery
- Resource tracking

## Monitoring and Logging

### Health Metrics
- Process state
- Tool availability
- Response times
- Error rates
- Connection status

### Detailed Logging
- Process lifecycle events
- Network operations
- Error conditions
- Performance metrics
- Debug information

## Error Handling

### Recovery Procedures
1. Connection Failures
   - Automatic retry with backoff
   - Resource cleanup
   - State reset
   - Fresh connection attempt

2. Process Failures
   - State detection
   - Resource cleanup
   - Process termination
   - Restart procedure

### Error Categories
- Connection failures
- Process termination
- Tool availability issues
- Network configuration errors
- Resource exhaustion

## Best Practices

### Process Management
- Use minimal required permissions
- Implement proper cleanup
- Monitor process health
- Handle errors gracefully

### Network Configuration
- Initialize network stack early
- Configure DNS appropriately
- Manage thread pools
- Enable relevant debugging

### Resource Handling
- Track all resources
- Clean up properly
- Monitor usage
- Handle errors
