# Personal AI Coaching System Roadmap

## Mission Statement
To create a deeply personalized AI coaching system that evolves with the user, combining the capabilities of large language models with personal data and insights to provide continuous support for personal growth, problem-solving, and emotional well-being. The system learns from interactions, consolidates knowledge effectively, and adapts its approaches based on what works best for specific needs and thought patterns.

## Core Principles
- **Privacy First**: All personal data stays local and under user control
- **Continuous Evolution**: System grows and adapts based on interactions
- **Pragmatic Implementation**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **Data-Informed Coaching**: Integrate health metrics and behavioral patterns
- **Organic Knowledge Building**: Let patterns and insights emerge naturally
- **Tool Augmentation**: Extend capabilities through carefully chosen integrations
