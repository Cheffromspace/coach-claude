# Project Roadmap

## Mission Statement
To create a robust implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) through two specialized components:
1. A Python MCP client that efficiently manages connections to multiple MCP servers
2. A TypeScript MCP server that provides deep Obsidian integration

## Core Principles
- **Protocol First**: MCP standardization and compliance as top priority
- **User Experience**: Focus on intuitive interactions and efficient token usage
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between client and server
- **Security**: Local-first architecture with strong isolation
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new tools and capabilities
