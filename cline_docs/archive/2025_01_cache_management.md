# Cache Management Implementation (January 2025)

## Cache Management Improvements
1. Chunked Conversation Caching:
   - Messages split into chunks (5 messages or 2000 tokens per chunk)
   - Each chunk gets separate ephemeral cache block
   - Prevents single large cache blocks that could hit limits
   - Automatic chunk size management based on content

2. Cache Block Management:
   - Added tracking of active, cleaned, and total blocks
   - Automatic cleanup of cache blocks when loading sessions
   - Clear monitoring of block creation and cleanup
   - Statistics available through /cache command

3. Cache Performance Monitoring:
   - Block allocation/deallocation tracking
   - Cache hit/miss ratios
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Block lifetime statistics
   - Token savings calculations

4. Optimizations:
   - Only cache substantial content (>1024 chars)
   - Separate recent messages from cached history
   - Chunked caching reduces memory pressure
   - Automatic cache cleanup on session load

## Implementation Details
1. Monitoring and Metrics:
   - Performance Tracking:
     * Cache Metrics:
       - Block allocation/deallocation rates
       - Cache hit/miss ratios
       - Memory usage patterns
       - Block lifetime statistics
     * Conversation Health:
       - Context retention rate
       - Reset frequency
       - Session duration
       - Coaching continuity score
     * System Stability:
       - Error rates by type
       - Resource cleanup success
       - Recovery effectiveness
       - System uptime

   - Alerting Thresholds:
     * Critical:
       - Conversation resets
       - Cache block exhaustion
       - Resource leaks
     * Warning:
       - High cache miss rates
       - Degraded context retention
       - Cleanup delays

2. Implementation Strategy:
   - Success Criteria:
     * Immediate actions:
       - No conversation resets for 1 hour of use
       - Cache warnings reduced by 50%
       - Complete state logs available
     * Short-term fixes:
       - No cache warnings for 4 hours of use
       - Context preserved between sessions
       - Clean shutdown every time
     * Long-term solutions:
       - Zero cache issues for 24 hours
       - Perfect context preservation
       - Robust error handling

   - Rollback Plans:
     * Immediate actions:
       - Keep backup of original system prompts
       - Save conversation state before changes
       - Document logging changes
     * Short-term fixes:
       - Version control all cache changes
       - Backup conversation manager state
       - Keep original cleanup code
     * Long-term solutions:
       - Implement feature flags
       - Phase rollouts gradually
       - Maintain backward compatibility
