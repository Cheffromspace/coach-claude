summary: Define hierarchical relationships between tags
description: Establishes parent-child relationships between tags to create a hierarchical tag structure that can be used for organization and enhanced searching.

examples:
  - |
    {
      "tag": "exercise",
      "parent": "health",
      "children": ["running", "weightlifting", "yoga"]
    }

sections:
  - title: Required Fields
    content: |
      - tag: string
        The tag to set hierarchy for

  - title: Optional Fields
    content: |
      - parent: string
        Parent tag to set for this tag

      - children: string[]
        Array of child tags for this tag

  - title: Hierarchy Rules
    content: |
      - A tag can have only one parent
      - A tag can have multiple children
      - Circular relationships are not allowed
      - Setting a new parent removes any existing parent relationship
      - Adding children creates bi-directional parent-child relationships
      - Removing a parent breaks all inherited relationships

  - title: Usage Notes
    content: |
      - Use hierarchies to create logical groupings of tags
      - Hierarchies affect tag-based searches when includeChildren is true
      - Parent tags provide context and organization
      - Child tags represent more specific subcategories
      - Tags can exist without being part of a hierarchy
