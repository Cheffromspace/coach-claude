  - title: Optional Fields
    content: |
      - filters: object
        * tags: string[] - Filter by tags
        * type: string - Filter by note type
        * dateRange: object
          - start: string - Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
          - end: string - End date (YYYY-MM-DD)

  - title: Query Syntax
    content: |
      The query syntax follows Dataview conventions:
      - FROM "folder" - Search in specific folder
      - WHERE condition - Filter by conditions
      - SORT field [ASC|DESC] - Sort results
      - LIMIT n - Limit number of results

  - title: Tag Query Shorthand
    content: |
      You can also use #tag syntax in queries:
      {
        "query": "#health #exercise"
      }

      This will be converted to:
      FROM "" WHERE contains(tags, "health") or contains(tags, "exercise")
