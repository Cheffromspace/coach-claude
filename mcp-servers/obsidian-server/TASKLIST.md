# Tool Handlers Refactoring

## Completed Tasks

1. Split monolithic tool-handlers.ts into modular components:
   - ✅ Created types.ts for core type definitions and interfaces
   - ✅ Created tool-definitions.ts for tool schemas and documentation
   - ✅ Created utils/note-utils.ts for note creation utilities
   - ✅ Created handlers/tag-handlers.ts for tag management
   - ✅ Created handlers/search-handlers.ts for search operations
   - ✅ Created handlers/note-handlers.ts for note operations
   - ✅ Refactored main tool-handlers.ts to use new modules

2. Organized code by responsibility:
   - ✅ Types and interfaces in types.ts
   - ✅ Tool definitions and schemas in tool-definitions.ts
   - ✅ Note utilities in utils/note-utils.ts
   - ✅ Tag operations in handlers/tag-handlers.ts
   - ✅ Search/query operations in handlers/search-handlers.ts
   - ✅ Note creation/updates in handlers/note-handlers.ts

3. Reduced main tool-handlers.ts complexity:
   - ✅ Removed direct implementation details
   - ✅ Added handler class properties
   - ✅ Implemented delegation to specialized handlers
   - ✅ Maintained same external interface

## Current Build Issue

The build is failing due to a naming convention mismatch between server.ts and our refactored tool-handlers.ts:

### Context
- The original codebase used camelCase method names (e.g., createJournal, readNotes)
- During refactoring, we used snake_case for consistency with MCP conventions (e.g., create_journal, read_notes)
- server.ts still expects camelCase methods, causing TypeScript errors

### Specific Errors
Method name mismatches:
- createJournal → create_journal
- readNotes → read_notes
- searchNotes → search_notes
- queryNotes → query_notes
- discoverVault → discover_vault
- createGoal → create_goal
- createHabit → create_habit
- updateGoalStatus → update_goal_status
- updateHabitTracking → update_habit_tracking
- createHealthMetric → create_health_metric

## Next Steps

1. Update server.ts to use snake_case (recommended for MCP consistency)

2. Implement solution:
   - Update affected files
   - Run build again to verify
   - Add tests if needed

3. Complete task.

3. Documentation:



## Future Considerations

Documentation:

   - Update any relevant documentation
   - Add comments explaining naming convention choice
   - Document any breaking changes

1. Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
2. Consider adding ESLint rules to enforce naming conventions
3. Add more comprehensive testing for the modular components
4. Consider creating a migration guide if this is a breaking change
